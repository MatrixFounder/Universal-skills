"""The human channel: reports and `--help` survive a non-UTF-8 locale.

The defect: stderr is opened errors="backslashreplace" and survives, but stdout
gets "surrogateescape" (or "strict" under an explicit PYTHONIOENCODING), and
neither can represent an em dash — surrogateescape rescues lone surrogates and
nothing else. One `—` or `✓` in a report, or in an argparse `help=` string,
took the whole command down.

Measured before the fix: nothing — `render.py --help` already held. The handler is installed
so the next `—` added to a progress line cannot reintroduce a crash,
and these tests are what make that claim checkable.

The contract is OBEY the caller's codec, not ignore it. Writing UTF-8 into a
terminal that declared cp1252 is mojibake, not robustness — so the fix degrades
per character and leaves a working machine's bytes untouched.

The fix lives on the STREAM (`codecs.register_error` + `reconfigure(errors=)`),
not at the call sites, so these tests are in two halves: the handler's own
behaviour, and — the half that actually catches regressions — proof that every
command in this skill installs it.
