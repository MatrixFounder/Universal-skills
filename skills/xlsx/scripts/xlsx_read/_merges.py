"""F3 — merge resolution + policy + overlap detector.

Three concerns:

1. `parse_merges(ws)` materialises openpyxl's `ws.merged_cells.ranges`
   into a `MergeMap` (anchor `(row, col)` → bottom-right `(row, col)`,
   inclusive 1-based). Stable, plain-Python representation that
   downstream code (`_overlapping_merges_check`, `apply_merge_policy`)
   can iterate without poking at openpyxl types.

2. `apply_merge_policy(rows, merges, policy)` is a **pure** function:
   it returns a *new* row-grid, never mutates the input. Three policies
   per ARCHITECTURE §4.1:
       - "anchor-only" — top-left carries the value; rest is `None`.
       - "fill"        — anchor value broadcast to every cell.
       - "blank"       — semantic alias of "anchor-only" in v1.

3. `_overlapping_merges_check(ranges)` performs an O(n²) pairwise
   intersection test (M8 + D4 fix). openpyxl 3.1.5 was empirically
   confirmed to silently accept overlapping merges (test_workbook.py
   `TestOpenpyxlOverlappingMergesBehaviour`), so explicit detection
   is the **only** way the library can fail loud on corrupted inputs.
