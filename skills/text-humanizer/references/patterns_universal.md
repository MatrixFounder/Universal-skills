# Universal AI Writing Patterns ("The Deadly Sins")

These patterns betray AI generation in ANY genre. They must be removed or rewritten regardless of whether the text is a tweet or an encyclopedia entry.

## 1. The "AI Vocabulary"
Words that have statistically exploded in usage since 2023.
*   **Verbs:** delve, underscore, highlight, bridge, foster, navigate, leverage, align.
*   **Nouns:** tapestry, landscape (abstract), realm, testament, interplay, nuance, intricacies.
*   **Adjectives:** vibrant, crucial, pivotal, intricate, seamless, robust, dynamic.
*   **Adverbs:** undoubtedly, arguably, meticulous.

## 2. The "False Range"
Using "from X to Y" where X and Y are not on a meaningful linear scale.
*   *AI:* "From the bustling streets of Tokyo to the quiet introspection of a tea ceremony..."
*   *Fix:* Just list them or find a real connection.

## 3. Negative Parallelism / "Not just X, but Y"
Overused sentence structure trying to sound profound.
*   *AI:* "It's not just a phone; it's a gateway to the world." / "The goal is not merely to win, but to dominate."
*   *Fix:* Be direct. "It's a powerful phone."

## 4. The "Rule of Three" Addiction
Forcing ideas into triads.
*   *AI:* "Create a seamless, intuitive, and robust experience."
*   *Fix:* Cut to the one word that actually matters.

## 5. Elegant Variation (Synonym Cycling)
Refusing to reuse a noun, leading to weird synonyms.
*   *AI:* "The dog barked. The canine ran. The four-legged companion slept."
*   *Fix:* Use pronouns ("he/it") or just repeat the word if it's the subject.

## 6. Meaningless Transitions
Filler words at the start of sentences.
*   *AI:* "Moreover, Additionally, Furthermore, In conclusion, To summarize..."
*   *Fix:* Delete them. The sentences usually flow better without them.

## 7. The "Colon Disease"
Excessive use of "Title: Description" lists.
*   *AI:* "**Efficiency:** The system is fast."
*   *Fix:* Write normal paragraphs or integrated lists.

## 8. The "-ing" Footer (Superficial Analysis)
Tacking on a present participle phrase to the end of a sentence to fake depth.
*   *AI:* "The dam was built in 1950, **underscoring** the region's commitment to modernization." / "..., **reflecting** the cultural shift."
*   *Fix:* Cut it. "The dam was built in 1950." (The reader can figure out the implication).

## 9. Em Dash Abuse
Replacing commas with em dashes to sound "punchy" or sales-y.
*   *AI:* "The solution is simple — efficient — and robust."
*   *Fix:* Use commas. "The solution is simple, efficient, and robust."

## 10. Chatbotisms (The "Helpful Assistant")
Leftover conversational artifacts.
*   *AI:* "I hope this helps!" / "Here is a breakdown:" / "Certainly!" / "In summary,"
*   *Fix:* Delete. The content should stand alone.
