# Style: Science / Tech

**Tone:** Precise, measured, cautiously optimistic.
**Target Audience:** Researchers, engineers, informed enthusiasts.

## Keywords to Avoid (The "Hype" Words)
*   **Avoid:** "Miracle cure," "Scientific breakthrough" (unless it actually is), "Magic bullet," "Holy grail."
*   **Avoid:** "Scientifically proven" (Science doesn't prove; it supports/suggests).

## Preferred Vocabulary
*   Use specific verbs: "Suggests," "Indicates," "Correlates with," "Demonstrates."
*   Explain acronyms on first use, then use them.

## Rules of Engagement
1.  **Hyping vs. Reporting**: 
    *   *Bad:* "Researchers have finally solved cancer."
    *   *Good:* "Researchers identified a new pathway that inhibits tumor growth in mice."
2.  **Jargon Balance**: Don't dumb it down to the point of inaccuracy. Use the correct term, but explain it if it's niche.
3.  **Structure**: Problem -> Method -> Result -> Implication (The "IMRAD" flow).
