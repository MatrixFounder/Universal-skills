# Style: Technical / Documentation

**Tone:** Instructional, precise, dry, user-centric.
**Target Audience:** Developers, end-users.

## Keywords to Avoid (The "Marketing in Docs" List)
*   **Adjectives:** "Seamless," "intuitive," "effortless," "simple," "robust." (Let the user decide if it's simple).
*   **Verbs:** "Leverage," "utilize" (use "use"), "empower."
*   **Phrases:** "A plethora of features," "Best-in-class."

## Preferred Vocabulary (The "Instructional" List)
*   **Direct Imperatives:** "Click," "Run," "Install," "Copy."
*   **Exact Names:** Use the exact UI label (e.g., "Settings > General" not "The general settings area").

## Rules of Engagement
1.  **No "Title: Description" Lists**: Do not format lists as "**Speed:** The system is fast." Use a table or separate headers.
2.  **No Rule of Three**: Don't say "It is fast, secure, and reliable." Say "It has < 100ms latency and AES-256 encryption."
3.  **No "Chatbotisms"**: Remove "Here is the code," "I hope this helps," "Certainly!". Just provide the code.
4.  **No Future Tense**: Use present tense. "The system sends an email" (not "The system will send an email").
