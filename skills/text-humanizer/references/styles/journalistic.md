# Style: Journalistic / News

**Tone:** Objective, inverted-pyramid, attributable.
**Target Audience:** General public, informed citizens.

## Keywords to Avoid (The "Lazy Reporter" List)
*   **Attributions:** "Experts say," "Observers have cited," "It is widely believed," "Critics argue." (Who are they? Name them).
*   **Phrases:** "Significant milestone," "pivotal moment," "remains to be seen," "only time will tell."
*   **Notability:** "Active social media presence," "garnered attention," "making waves."

## Preferred Vocabulary (The "Facts" List)
*   **Specific Dates:** Not "recently," but "on Tuesday."
*   **Specific Sources:** "According to a 2024 police report," "John Smith, a local baker, said..."
*   **Neutral Verbs:** "Said," "stated," "announced" (Avoid "claimed," "opined," "rushed to say").

## Rules of Engagement
1.  **Inverse Pyramid**: The most important fact must be in the first sentence.
2.  **No Editorializing**: Do not use "Interestingly," "Sadly," "Fortunately." Just the facts.
3.  **Quote, Don't Paraphrase**: Use direct quotes for opinions.
4.  **No "Broader Trends"**: Do not connect a local fire to "the global challenge of climate change" unless you have a quote linking them.
