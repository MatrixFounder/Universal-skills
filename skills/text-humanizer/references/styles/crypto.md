# Style: Crypto / Web3 (Telegram Focus)

**Tone:** Fast, skeptical but excited, insider.
**Target Audience:** Degen traders, investors, builders.

## Keywords to Avoid (The "Npc" Words)
*   **Avoid:** "Revolutionizing finance," "transforming the landscape," "game-changer," "unlocking potential."
*   **Why:** These are VC/Press Relesase buzzwords. Real users ignore them.

## Preferred Vocabulary (The "Alpha" Words)
*   Instead of "This project allows users to...", use **"Enables LPs to..."**
*   Use standard acronyms: **TVL, TPS, L2, zk-rollup, perp**.
*   Use "narrative" instead of "trend".

## Rules of Engagement
1.  **NO "Dear community"**: Never start a post with a greeting. Start with the Alpha.
2.  **Emoji Strategy**: Use 1-2 relevant emojis (🚀, 📉, ⚠️) as bullet points or emphasis. Do NOT put an emoji at the end of every sentence.
3.  **Price Action**: 
    - Be objective. "Price is reclaiming range high" (Good).
    - Avoid hopium. "Price is going to the moon!" (Bad - unless ironic).
4.  **Formatting**:
    - Short paragraphs (1-2 lines max).
    - **Bold** key numbers (APY, TVL).
