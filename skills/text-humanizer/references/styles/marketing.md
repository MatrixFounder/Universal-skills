# Style: Marketing / Copywriting

**Tone:** Persuasive, benefit-driven, confident (but not arrogant).
**Target Audience:** Customers, leads, public.

## Keywords to Avoid (The "Puffery" List)
*   **Adjectives:** "Vibrant," "breathtaking," "stunning," "world-class," "premier," "state-of-the-art," "cutting-edge," "seamless," "intuitive."
*   **Verbs:** "Boasts," "showcases," "exemplifies," "elevate," "unleash," "unlock."
*   **Phrases:** "Nestled in the heart of...", "A testament to...", "Experience the magic of...", "One-stop shop."

## Preferred Vocabulary (The "Benefit" List)
*   Use specific features: Instead of "robust security," use "256-bit encryption."
*   Use specific outcomes: Instead of "boosts productivity," use "saves 2 hours per week."

## Rules of Engagement
1.  **No "Rule of Three"**: Do not say "Fast, reliable, and secure." Pick the ONE thing that matters most and prove it.
2.  **No "Em Dash" Hype**: Avoid using "—" to create artificial excitement. Use periods.
3.  **The "Nestled" Rule**: Never describe a location as "nestled" unless it is literally a bird in a nest. Use "located" or "situated."
4.  **No "Welcome"**: Do not start with "Welcome to the world of X". start with the user's problem.
