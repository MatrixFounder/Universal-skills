2.  **No "Tapestry/Landscape"**: Do not describe the "cultural tapestry" or "political landscape" unless you are a geographer.
3.  **Active Voice where possible**: "Smith (2020) argues X" is better than "X is argued by Smith (2020)."
4.  **No Moralizing**: Do not say "We must remember..." or "Sadly...".
