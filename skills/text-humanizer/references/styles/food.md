# Style: Food / Culinary

**Tone:** Sensory, evocative, warm, specific.
**Target Audience:** Home cooks, foodies, hungry people.

## Keywords to Avoid (The "Lazy" Words)
*   **Avoid:** "Delicious," "tasty," "yummy," "mouth-watering," "flavorful."
*   **Why:** These words tell me nothing about *how* it tastes. They are generic fillers.

## Preferred Vocabulary (Sensory)
*   **Texture:** Crispy, shattered, unctuous, jammy, brittle, tender, fudgy.
*   **Taste:** Bracing, bright, earthy, nutty, caramelized, smoky, acidic.

## Rules of Engagement
1.  **Show, Don't Tell**:
    *   *Bad:* "The soup was creamy and delicious."
    *   *Good:* "The soup coats the back of a spoon and smells like roasted garlic."
2.  **Personal Touch**: Connect food to a specific moment. "Perfect for a rainy Tuesday" or "The kind of meal you eat over the sink."
3.  **No "Symphony of Flavors"**: This is an immediate AI tell.
