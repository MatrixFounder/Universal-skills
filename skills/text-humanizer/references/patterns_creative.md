# Creative & Personal Patterns ("Adding Soul")

These instructions are for **Blog**, **Opinion**, **Social Media**, and **Personal** genres. DO NOT use these for Wikipedia.

## 1. Have an Opinion
*   **Rule:** Don't just report thoughts; react to them.
*   **Example:** instead of "The movie received mixed reviews," say "I honestly didn't know whether to laugh or cry at that ending."

## 2. Embrace Imperfection and Uncertainty
*   **Rule:** Real humans have doubts. AI is confidently wrong or neutrally vague.
*   **Example:** "I *think* this is how it works, but don't quote me on it." / "The truth is probably somewhere boring in the middle."

## 3. Use the First Person ("I")
*   **Rule:** First person isn't unprofessional in blogs/social; it's honest.
*   **Example:** "I keep coming back to..." / "Here's what gets me..."

## 4. Vary Sentence Rhythm (The "Pulse")
*   **Rule:** Mix short, punchy sentences with long, winding flow. AI writes in medium-length blocks.
*   **Example:** "It failed. Completely and utterly. And yet, looking back at the logs from that long Tuesday night, I see something else."

## 5. Be Specific (Concrete Details)
*   **Rule:** Replace abstract claims with sensory or specific details.
*   **Example:** instead of "The office was chaotic," say "The office smelled like stale coffee and anxiety at 3 PM."

## 6. Let Some Mess In
*   **Rule:** Perfect structure feels algorithmic. Use tangents, asides (in parentheses), or half-formed thoughts.
*   **Example:** "This is huge (or maybe it's nothing, who knows?)."
