# Encyclopedic & Academic Patterns (Wiki-Style)

These patterns specifically violate the neutral point of view (NPOV) and encyclopedic tone.

## 1. Puffery / Peacock Terms
Words that praise without facts.
*   **Avoid:** breathtaking, legendary, state-of-the-art, cutting-edge, world-class, prestigious, iconic, visionary.
*   **Fix:** Use FACTS. "The building is 800m tall" (not "The building is a stunning marvel").

## 2. "Serves as a testament"
The ultimate filler phrase.
*   **Avoid:** "serves as a testament to," "stands as a beacon," "is a reminder of."
*   **Fix:** Delete. "The ruin shows the city's age" (not "The ruin serves as a testament to the city's age").

## 3. Vague Attribution (Weasel Words)
*   **Avoid:** "Experts say," "Critics argue," "It is widely believed," "Some suggest."
*   **Fix:** WHO says? "According to the 2023 IPCC report..." or delete the sentence if you have no source.

## 4. "Despite its challenges..." Conclusions
The formulaic "Challenges and Future Outlook" wrap-up.
*   **Avoid:** "Despite these challenges, the future looks bright..."
*   **Fix:** Stop when the facts run out. You don't need a moral of the story or a happy ending conclusion.

## 5. Moralizing / Sycophancy
*   **Avoid:** "It is important to note," "We must remember," "Sadly," "Fortunately."
*   **Fix:** Just state the fact.

## 6. Copula Avoidance
Using fancy verbs instead of "is/are".
*   **Avoid:** "The festival marks a celebration of..." "The tool features an ability to..."
*   **Fix:** "The festival celebrates..." "The tool can..."

## 7. Forced Connection to "Broader Trends"
Trying to make mundane topics sound globally significant.
*   **Avoid:** Connecting a local event/species to "climate change," "globalization," or "the tapestry of life" without specific proof.
*   **AI:** "The local bakery's closing reflects the shifting landscape of global commerce."
*   **Fix:** Just say it closed.
