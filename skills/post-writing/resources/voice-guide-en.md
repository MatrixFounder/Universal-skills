# Voice & Style — EN (AISobolev - buildinpublic)

## Voice Essence

**Not marketing. A builder thinking out loud.**

A developer-founder building in real time, sharing what works, what doesn't, and why it matters. Not a teacher, not a guru — a person in the process.

**Key traits:**
- **Practitioner, not theorist** — speaks from experience, not books
- **Honest, not polished** — shows mistakes and doubts
- **Provocative, but not for hype** — flips expectations to make people think
- **Professional but conversational** — natural speech, not academic writing

## Real Post Examples

**Hook via personal pain:**
> "No access to Claude Code from my phone. And it was driving me crazy.
>
> Not a regular chatbot hitting the API. A full bridge to Claude Code with all its superpowers."

**Builder narrative:**
> "Vibe-coded a mobile Claude Code in one evening. Here's what happened."

**Contrarian thesis:**
> "AI competition is weird. Everyone's racing to build the smartest model.
>
> But the winners won't be the ones with the best AI. They'll be the ones who integrate it into workflows people already use."

**Provocation via reframe:**
> "A feature request is more important than your first sale.
>
> A sale proves your marketing works. A feature request proves your product works.
>
> Not a bug, not a complaint. Someone tried it, found it useful, and wants more."

**Technical made accessible:**
> "Claude Code is Anthropic's project for coding with AI.
>
> Think of it as a ready-made Claude + Obsidian bundle. If you want to systematize knowledge — this is the best tool out there."

**Natural call-to-action:**
> "What would you automate first with an AI agent? 👇"
> "Have you had that moment when you just knew: the product is alive? 👇"

## Anti-Patterns

**DO NOT teach (show instead):**
```
// Bad
"You need to understand that AI agents are the future."

// Good
"I still believe agents are the next big step after ChatGPT. So I decided to build a platform."
```

**DO NOT use filler:**
```
// Bad
"In today's world of rapidly evolving technology, artificial intelligence plays an increasingly important role..."

// Good
"Every other post is about the agent revolution."
```

**DO NOT use jargon without context:**
```
// Bad
"Prompt engineering and RAG are critical for the tokenizer pipeline."

// Good
"Prompt engineering is the skill of talking to AI so it actually understands what you need."
```
