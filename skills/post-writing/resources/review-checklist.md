# Post Review Checklist

## Core

- [ ] **Hook** — Contradiction, intrigue, or provocation in the first line?
- [ ] **Structure** — Follows Problem → Reframe → Action?
- [ ] **Accessible** — Non-technical readers can understand? Terms explained via application?
- [ ] **Personal** — Based on personal experience, not theory?
- [ ] **No fluff** — Every sentence earns its place?
- [ ] **Dialogue** — Ends with a question or call-to-reaction?
- [ ] **Simple** — No parcellation, no em-dashes, short paragraphs?

## Advanced (from top posts analysis 2026)

- [ ] **Data + Narrative + Framework** — All three layers present?
- [ ] **Specific numbers in first lines** — Not "many" but "776"?
- [ ] **Authority embedded, not claimed** — Details instead of titles?
- [ ] **Ending provokes discussion** — Moral dilemma > poll?
- [ ] **Platform formatting correct** — → arrows for LinkedIn, markdown for Telegram?

**All ✅ — publish. Any ❌ — revise.**
